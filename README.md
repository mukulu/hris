# HRIS
====

Human Resource Information System(HRIS) is a software that enables organisations to collect,
validate, analyse and present raw and statistical human resource information for reporting,
analysis and decision making. It is a generic software tool that allows customization
to fit organization specific requirements, its built with open meta-data models and flexible
and customizable user interface that allows user to adjust the system to peform, behave,
look and feel based on organisation's specific requirements without the need for
software development.

or (at your option) any later version.

## Installing Hris Software
----------------------------

#### PHP5-INTL Dependency

On Systems running Linux Operating systems run

	sudo apt-get install php5-intl
	
On Systems running Mac OSX Operating systems run

	brew install icu4c

#### Download system source codes from our [github repository](https://github.com/hrisproject/hris) - https://github.com/hrisproject/hris
	git clone https://github.com/hrisproject/hris.git
	
Install composer inside project directory - hris Note: hris now comes with composer pre-installed

	curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	
If you don't have curl, install composer with this script
	php -r "eval('?>'.file_get_contents('https://getcomposer.org/installer'));"
	
Update your repository with latest dependecies

	php composer.phar install
	php composer.phar update
	
Symbolic Link your web directory to the webroot directory

	ln -s ${PWD}/web/ /var/www/hris		#Assuming your current directory(PWD) is inside hris project and your webroot is on /var/www/
	
Set date time zone inside php.ini to your location,change line date.timezone to your locale, e.g in Dar-es-salaam, Tanzania

	date.timezone = 'Africa/Dar_es_Salaam'
	
Turn off short_open_tag inside php.ini to disable detection of PHP codes between <? and ?> for better PHP >=5.3 Experience

	short_open_tag = Off
	
Give Web readwrite access to cache and log directory in your hris directory.
To enjoy both user and web read-write access in linux use the following commands:

	rm -rf app/cache/*
	rm -rf app/logs/*
	
On Systems supporting chmod +a(e.g. Mac), you can give readwrite permission via

	sudo chmod +a "www-data allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs
	sudo chmod +a "`whoami` allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs
	
On Systems that don't support chmod +a(e.g. Linux), you can give readwrite permission via

	sudo setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwx -m u:`whoami`:rwx app/cache app/logs
	sudo setfacl -dR -m u:www-data:rwx -m u:`whoami`:rwx app/cache app/logs


## Database Setup
-----------------
Database configuration can be found from hris/app/config/parameters.yml.

Note: parameters.yml is autogenerated everytime composer updates dependencies.


### Parameters.yml:
	database_driver: pdo_pgsql
	database_host: %databasehost%
	database_port: %portnumber%
	database_name: %databasename%
	database_user: %databaseuser%
	database_password: %userpassowrd%
	mailer_transport: smtp
	mailer_host: %mailerhost%
	mailer_user: null
	mailer_password: null
	locale: en
	secret: %secret_generated_key%
	database_path: null

### Generating database
	app/console doctrine:database:drop --force		#Drops Database if it exist
	app/console doctrine:database:create			#Creates Fresh new database
	app/console doctrine:schema:update --force		#Updates Database schema
	app/console list								#List all commands offered
	
### Creating, Activating,Changing password, deactivate, demote & promote login-user from commandline

### Regenerating assets

### Shell Console
	app/console --shell

## Performance tuning
	File php.ini can be used to tweak performance of the system

## Eclipse Tricks
-----------------
Eclipse is the favoured IDE for HRIS development, followed by PHPStorm, the following are development plugins for eclipse.

1. [Yedit - Eclipse plugin for YAML Files](http://code.google.com/p/yedit/) from Update site: http://dadacoalition.org/yedit
2. [Symfony Eclipse Plugin](https://github.com/pulse00/Symfony-2-Eclipse-Plugin) from Update site: http://p2.dubture.com or [MarketPlace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=220368)
3. With those software sources, install plugins from the two sources, that is
	Composer
	Json Edit
	Miscellaneous
	Phing
	Symfony
	Twig
	YEdit
4. [Install PHP Tool Integration for testing](http://www.phpsrc.org/) offers PHPUnit test and Copy/Paste Detector, update site: http://www.phpsrc.org/eclipse/pti/
5. [Less - Eclipse plugin](http://www.normalesup.org/~simonet/soft/ow/eclipse-less.fr.html) offers support for less syntax, update site: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/
